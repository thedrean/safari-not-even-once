## Synopsis

A way to install Google Chrome on a new Apple OSX laptop without ever having to open safari.

## Code Example

```bash
./safari-not-even-once.sh
```

## Motivation

Apple laptops are great, but Safari is not so. I have only ever used Safari to download chrome, but on my new laptop, I did not even want to openSafari once.

## Installation

```bash
git
```

*Your new mac should prompt you to install dev-tools, do it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thedrean/safari-not-even-once.git
cd safari-not-even-once
chmod +x safari-not-even-once.sh
./safari-not-even-once.sh
```
